3D Components
=============

These are various components and assemblies that I have modeled for use 
in designing 3D printed objects.

I hope you can find some of them as useful as I have.

Thanks to [Adafruit][1] and [Arduino][2] for putting their pcb files on the 
web, which makes the assemblies possible. Also, thanks to [kcswalter][9] for his
excellent 3D models, which I made heavy use of.

Thanks to the following open source software packages:
* [Blender][3]
* [FreeCAD][4]
* [OpenSCAD][5]
